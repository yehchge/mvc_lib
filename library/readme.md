# JREAM Library - Utilities for PHP
## 

The JREAM Library is an Open Source PHP library licensed under the GPLv3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

## Overview
I care about making handy stuff very easy to use. Clever programming and over-engineering can be fun to write, 
but it stinks to use. I hope I didn't get buck-wild and miss the point. Hope you guys enjoy the library. 

Please always download the latest stable version from the GitHub *Tags* (Under the Branches Drop Down).

## Minimum Requirements
- PHP 5.3
- For Database: MySQL PDO Enabled
- For Image: GD Library

##Get Started

The easiest way to start is to look at examples, copy and paste from the docs:
- In the /doc folder
- Or here: <http://jream.com/doc/>

##At The End of the Day

If this isn't easy to use, trash it and forget about it. The Library was created with you in mind, so that you
can drop it in a folder and use it with a baby learning curve -- often that's a task that much easier said than done!
