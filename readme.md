# JREAM Library Skeleton
## 

This is a simple example of using the MVC Framework.

## Things to Notice

- Create a database called jream-library and dump the schema.sql inside
- Your configuration settings in the index.php file
- Your database settings are in the model/model.php file
- Make sure you see the .htaccess file (It's hidden on Linux/Mac)
- I made sure to include _.htaccess if you dont see it, just rename it to .htaccess

## If you have problems or suggestions

Please start an issue on GitHub, thanks.
